Original idea from

Experimenting with new metrics using Voronoi diagrams: the number near the goal is the % of the relevant area "owned" by the attacking team. 
The number goes up from 15% to 30% with the key pass of the play. 
Useful to calculate goal contribution?


Just the normal TV angle + some image processing



Gotcha, makes sense for relevant area! I definitely agree with its ability to identify key passes, too. 
It's hard to quantify "most" though, wouldn't you say? It could be the pass by 7, it could be the run or the pass from 11, or it could even be that 9 stayed in line with 11.



For me there are two important moments: one, 11 (Reus) moves behind the opposing defenders, and two, 7 (Sancho) passes to Reus. From then on Dortmund has the upper hand.



Not bothering at all! I use Python (maplotlib for plotting and shapely/scipy for spatial algorithms)
